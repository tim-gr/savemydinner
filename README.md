# Save My Dinner

This is an Android app (implemented in Kotlin) to always have an idea what to have for dinner. The information is retrieved from the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/).

It is a hobby project to apply knowledge in parallel to taking Android courses.

The minimum functionality will be:
- Searching for recipes based on included and excluded ingredients.
- Detailed descriptions of the recipes which are easy to handle while cooking.
- Possibly more "support" during cooking by providing timers and the right music.
- Saving favorite recipes
- Creating shopping lists based on selected recipes
